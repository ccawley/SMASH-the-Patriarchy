          <p>On October 5th 2017, a bombshell <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html" target="blank">report</a> by Jodi Kantor & Megan Twohey detailed & unveiled Harvey Weinstein's decades long history of abusing his position of power in the film industry to help him get away with sexual harassment, misconduct & worse. While he is certainly not the first man to be revealed as an abuser, this story ignited a global conversation about sexual harassment unlike any that's been seen before. Often referred to as the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MeToo?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="blank">#metoo</a> movement, women have flooded forward with stories of experiencing sexual harassment. In the months since the original story, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-97-men-and-one-woman-taken-down-by-the-metoo-movement" target="blank">nearly a hundred</a> powerful men have been brought down by allegations of their own misconduct. Unfortunately, this is not a story that begins & ends with politically powerful & otherwise famous men. A <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/19/1-in-3-women-sexually-harassed-work-cosmopolitan_n_6713814.html" target="blank"> recent survey</a> found that 1 in 3 women have experienced sexual harassment at work. Another in-depth & crucial read by Susan Chira & Catrin Einhorn, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/ford-chicago-sexual-harassment.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0" target="blank">set in two of Ford's Chicago plants</a>, reveals just how pervasive this problem is. It is also important to note the #metoo movement is not new but was in fact started over 10 years ago by activist <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/us/me-too-tarana-burke-origin-trnd/index.html" target="blank">Tarana Burke</a>.</p>

          <p>This project was also inspired by & named after the phrase <i>"SMASH! the patriarchy"</i> because that is exactly what we need to do as a society to address this problem & make the world a safer, more egalitarian place. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy" target="blank">Patriarchy</a> is an unjust social system in which males hold primary power & predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege & control of property. Just one of many ways this system manifests itself is in the objectification of women as sexual objects that are to be available for men's sexual gratification whenever & wherever they'd like. Full stop, this is not okay, if you're a man, I have a call to action for you to be an ally to women & the #metoo movement. Start with some reading <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ways-men-can-be-an-ally-to-women-sexual-harassment_uk_59e8749fe4b00905bdaedf67" target="blank">here</a>...& <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/21/opinions/what-men-can-do-me-too-stamp-opinion/index.html" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

          <p>If you feel called to donate to organizations who's goal is to help the victems of sexual harassment I encourage you to donate to the following charities or do some research & find one you'd like to donate to.</p>
